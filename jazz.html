        <div id="text_7" class='uppercase hidden'>SWING</div>
        <div id="text_8" class='prueba lowercase hidden'>it is partly planned and partly spontaneous; that is, as the musicians perform a pre-determined tune, they have the opportunity to create their own interpretations within that tune in response to the other musicians' performances and whatever
            else may occur "in the moment", this is called improvisation and is the defining element of jazz. in everything from regular conversation, to basketball, to everyday life, americans are constantly improvising.</div>
        <div id="text_9" class='lowercase hidden'>john coltrane was an american jazz saxophonist and composer. working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. he led at least fifty recording
            sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter miles davis and pianist thelonious monk</div>
        <div id="text_10" class='lowercase hidden'>when jazz musicians improvise, they are playing the notes that they hear in their mind; they hear these notes just a split second before they play them</div>
        <div id="text_11" class='lowercase hidden'>tempo is the speed of the beat. jazz tunes can be played at any tempo from extremely slow to extremely fast. most styles of jazz keep a steady beat.</div>
        <div id="text_12" class='lowercase hidden'>swing rhythm is notated as a two-element beat with a lead-in note leading into the accented main note. the length of the lead-in note may vary. in the shuffle example shown below, the lead-in and the main note are of the same length.</div>
        <div id="text_13" class='lowercase hidden'>improvisation is the key element of jazz.</div>
        <div id="text_14" class='lowercase hidden'>jazz was born in the united states.</div>
        <div id="text_15" class='lowercase hidden'>ragtime is primarily an african american invention and was a source of pride to african american composers, musicians, and listeners.</div>
        <div id="text_16" class='lowercase hidden'>improvisation is inventing something on the spur of the moment and in response to a certain situation; in jazz, it is when musicians perform a different interpretation each time they play the same tune, a tune is never played the exact same way
            twice, whether played by the same musicians or an entirely different group; the improvisation becomes its own musical dialogue between band members without any preconceived notion of what the final outcome will be.</div>
        <div id="text_17" class='lowercase hidden'>playing their instruments is as natural as skating.</div>
        <div id="text_18" class='lowercase hidden'>with jazz, because of its improvisational aspect, the musicians are communicating the emotion of the moment; that is, the emotion they are feeling while they are performing. remember, when improvising they are deciding what notes to play as they
            respond to the music of the moment and of the other musicians.</div>
        <div id="text_19" class='lowercase hidden'>jazz is life, is fire and freedom.</div>
        <div id="text_20" class='lowercase hidden'>jazz musicians do the same with their instruments, but rather than using words to communicate, they use music; it's kind of like musical conversation.</div>
        <div id="text_21" class='lowercase hidden'>jazz developed in the united states in the very early part of the 20th century. new orleans, near the mouth of the mississippi river, played a key role in this development. the city's population was more diverse than anywhere else in the south,
            and people of african, french, caribbean, italian, german, mexican, and american indian, as well as english, descent interacted with one another. african-american musical traditions mixed with others and gradually jazz emerged from a blend
            of ragtime, marches, blues, and other kinds of music. at first jazz was mostly for dancing. (in later years, people would sit and listen to it.) after the first recordings of jazz were made in 1917, the music spread widely and developed rapidly.
            the evolution of jazz was led by a series of brilliant musicians such as louis armstrong, duke ellington (listen to ellington in duke's music class), charlie parker, and miles davis.</div>
        <div id="text_22" class='lowercase hidden'>jazz can be seen as a personal language.</div>
        <div id="text_23" class='lowercase hidden'>it possesses a forward momentum and uses expressive notes that are slightly lower in pitch than those on the major scale.</div>
        <div id="text_24" class='lowercase hidden'>they play solos that they make up on the fly as they play.</div>
        <div id="text_25" class='lowercase hidden'>the musical traditions of african-americans mixed with other styles.</div>
        <div id="text_26" class='lowercase hidden'>some of the greatest musical minds of all-time were jazz artists. they were able to master their instruments, redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them. many of them did so while navigating
            through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed.</div>
        <div id="text_27" class='lowercase hidden'>to be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument. you are challenged to swing. you are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic
            minds of all time</div>
        <div id="text_28" class='lowercase hidden'>“don't play what's there; play what's not there.”</div>

        <div id="text_30" class='lowercase hidden'>“if you have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know.”</div>
